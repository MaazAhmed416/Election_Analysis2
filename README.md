## Summary of the elcection Audit 

### The benefits of the script
Knowing how important it is for the election comission to hold fair and legitimate elections, this script is the best way for them to know which county requires a higher number of staff/volunteers given the fact it clearly tells which county had the highest turnout rate. Moreover, the simplicity of such a breakdown is commendable. A script which clearly breaks down very important information and also easily read and understood is a script that all election commissions would want to use.

### Enhancing the script
Knowing what party the candidate represeents or whether the candidate is running independently is something that could be added to the script. This is useful information for the current elections and also for the future ones. Moreover, there is a large disparity between the voters turnout in the different couties. Maybe Diana only won because she was a native of Denver. Knowing what counties the candidates come from is useful information.
